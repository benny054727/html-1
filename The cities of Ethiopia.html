		 Anatomically modern humans emerged from modern-day Ethiopia and set out to the Near East and elsewhere in the Middle Paleolithic period.
		 Prehistoric Ethiopia was the home of various Afroasiatic and Nilotic tribes and cultures. 
		 In antiquity, the Kingdom of D'mt was established in the north frontier of Ethiopia, while the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region. 
		 Christianity arrived in the 4th-century and Islam was introduced in the 7th-century. After the collapse of Aksum, a variety of kingdoms thrived in what is known as Ethiopia. 
		 The Zagwe dynasty ruled the north-central parts until being overthrown by Yekuno Amlak in 1270; 
		 inaugurating the Ethiopian Empire and its Solomonic line dynasty claimed descent from the Biblical Solomon and Queen of Sheba under their son Menelik I. 
		 By the 14th century, the empire grew in prestige through territorial expansion until the mid-18th century decentralization known as Zemene Mesafint, 
		 and Ethiopia was reunified and modernized by Emperor Tewodros II in 1855.

		 <p>
		 Ethiopia in its current border and multinational state was formed under conquests of Emperor Menelik II. Externally, 
		 Menelik defeated the Italian colonists in 1896 during the Scramble for Africa, leaving Ethiopia and Liberia as independent African nations. 
		 In 1935, Ethiopia was occupied by Fascist Italy and annexed with Italian-possessed Eritrea and Somaliland, later forming Italian East Africa. 
		 In 1941, the British army together with the Ethiopian Arbegnoch unit liberated Ethiopia amidst the Second World War. 
		 The Derg, a Soviet-backed military junta, took power in 1974 after deposing Emperor Haile Selassie and the Solomonic dynasty, 
		 ruled the country nearly 17 years with a vicious civil war. 
		 After the collapse of Derg in 1991, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) dominated the country with a new constitution and ethnic-based federalism. 
		 Since then, Ethiopia suffered from prolonged and unsolved inter-ethnic clashes and political instability marked by democratic backsliding.

		 Ethiopia is a multi-ethnic state with over 80 different ethnic groups. Christianity and Islam are the main faiths observed in Ethiopia. 
		 This sovereign state is a founding member of the UN, the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement, the G77 and the Organisation of African Unity. 
		 Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, 
		 the African Standby Force and many of the global NGOs focused on Africa. Ethiopia is considered an emerging power and developing country. 
		 It experienced 9.4% economic growth from 2010 to 2020. The country is regarded as poor in terms of per capita income and the Human Development Index,
		 with high rates of poverty, poor respect for human rights, and a literacy rate of only 49% Agriculture is the largest sector in Ethiopia;
